## What is this?

A personal project to help me learn stock options pricing, European warrants and Blackâ€“Scholes model.

## The Plan

Hook this to a SPA or a Chrome extension that returns useful live data from a tRPC subscription to asses my trade republic warrants.

## TODO:
- [] Backtest these functions
- [] Set up a Scraping Endpoint with Puppeteer or Scraping Bee (unfortunately Trade Republic doesn't provide an API) 
- [] Build the SPA with Next js, Formik, MUI and Zod
- [] Containerize it
